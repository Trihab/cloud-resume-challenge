## Render Project Emulate Markdown

This backend is able to render markdown.
The file `render_project.py` will render the json with the markdown into html.

## Possible Enhancement

I'll probably convert this backend into a serverless cloud function. By the end of the year, I want to start my freelance career, so my portfolio will evolve and be upgraded.
